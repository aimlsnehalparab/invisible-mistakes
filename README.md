# Invisible Mistakes: Behavioral Cybersecurity Awareness Platform

An interactive cybersecurity awareness platform that demonstrates how normal-looking user actions can silently increase security risk — without collecting any real personal data.

This project focuses on human behavior, decision-making patterns, and risk psychology in digital environments.

## 🔎 Problem Statement

Users frequently interact with websites without understanding the security implications of their actions.

Common examples:
- Clicking "Allow Location"
- Accepting all cookies
- Staying logged in on shared devices
- Trusting urgency-based warnings
- Downloading free content without verification
- Trusting social proof blindly

These behaviors can enable profiling, social engineering, account compromise, and targeted attacks.

Most users do not recognize the invisible risks created by their own digital decisions.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Simulate realistic website interaction scenarios
- Track behavioral choices in a controlled environment
- Assign dynamic risk scores based on user actions
- Visualize behavioral risk through an executive-style dashboard
- Promote cybersecurity awareness through interactive education

---

## 🛡️ Ethical & Privacy Commitment

This platform:

- Does NOT collect real personal data
- Does NOT access real browser history
- Does NOT track real geolocation
- Does NOT store uploaded files
- Does NOT monitor outside the simulation

All analysis is simulated and runs entirely client-side.

This is an awareness tool — not a tracking system.
