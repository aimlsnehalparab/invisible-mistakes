# Invisible Mistakes: What You Expose Without Knowing

An interactive **Behavioral Cybersecurity Awareness Platform** that demonstrates how *normal-looking user actions* on websites can silently increase security risk — **without collecting any real personal data**.

This project focuses on **human behavior and decision-making**, not technical hacking.

## Problem Statement

Most users trust websites blindly and interact with common UI elements such as:
- “Allow location”
- “Accept all cookies”
- “Stay logged in”
- Urgency warnings
- Free downloads
- Social proof (“Trusted by thousands”)

While these actions feel harmless, they can **enable profiling, social engineering, and exploitation** in real-world systems.

**The problem:**  
Users are often unaware of the *invisible risks* created by their own behavior.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to:
- Simulate realistic website interactions
- Observe **user behavioral choices**
- Analyze how these choices contribute to security risk
- Present results using an **Executive-Style Risk Dashboard**
- Educate users through awareness, not fear or surveillance

## What This Project Does NOT Do

- Does NOT collect real user data  
- Does NOT access browser history  
- Does NOT track real location  
- Does NOT spy on the device  
- Does NOT store uploaded files  

All analysis is **simulated and client-side only**, based purely on user interactions within the website.
